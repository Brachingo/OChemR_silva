## Description
From a chemical reaction image, detect and classify molecules, text and arrows by using a Vision Transformer (DETR). The detections are then translated into text "OCR" or into SMILES. The direction of the reaction is detected and preserved into the output file.

Output:

```text
Reaction X

SMILES:
C=Cc1ccc2[nH]cc(C[C@H](N)C(=O)OF)c2c1>>C/C=C(\\C)CN1C2CCC(=O)[C@]1(C)Cc1c2[nH]c2ccc(C)cc12.O>>molecule8>>molecule5>>BCc1ccc2[nH]c3c(c2c1-c1c(O)ccc(C)c1C1=C(C)C2CC4/C(=C\\C)CN2C(C1)C4CC)CC1C(CC)C24CC3N1[C@@H]2/C4=C/C.C.CC=O.CC=O>>C=C1CC2(C#N)C3(C)CC1C1CCNC12CC1=C3Cc2ccc(C)c(-c3c([O-])ccc4[nH]c5c(c34)CC3C[C@H]4C5(C)CC(C)([C@@H](C)CCO)C34CC3CC3)c21

## Step by step
### 1 - Objects detection - ViT
A DETR model with a ResNet50 backbone is used to detect the objects in the image. Classes to be found = ["molecules","arrows","text", "+ symbols"]. Images of type "png" are feed as input and bounding boxes corresponding to the objects locations in a tensor type as well as its respective label are the returned outputs.

##### Training Dataset
Syntetic Dataset consisting of 50k images that are randomly created to simulate the real-world reactions publications distribution.

##### Training Parameters
* Learning Rate: 1e-4
* Learning Rate Backbone: 1e-5
* Learning Rate Drop: 22 epochs
* Weight Decay: 1e-5
* Epochs: 30
* Clip Max. Norm.: 0.1
* Dropout: 0.1

### 2 - OCR
OCR model from DocTr library was trained on chemical-related data generated from US chemical patents. To come up with the training data set, the Text Recognition Data Generator tool was used. The resulting weights were used to extract textual information from text detections.


### 3 - MolVec
Towards recognizing the information present in the molecule objects detected, we utilized the open-access user interface MolVec.

### 4 - Pixel Magic
In pursuance of preserving the real path of the whole reaction, the direction of the arrows detected was exctracted.

## Output Files
A randomly selected small sample of the test set is evaluated under the folders "test_results" of each approach. DETR, FRCNN and RetinaNet. Check qualitatevly the performance of the models in there.

Aggregating the aforementioned steps outcome, we can reconstruct JSON and text files.
```json

    "arrow11": {
        "prev_mol": "CCCC#N.CCCC[Al](CC(C)C)CC(C)C",
        "text": ["-duction of nit-ile", "Coordination of nitrog- pair to the ilum-"],

    },

```

## Benchmarking
The synthetic training data set was benchmarked with well-established CNNs and a feature detector approach. As a one-stage detector, RetinaNet. As a two-stages detector, Faster-RCNN. However, DETR with default training schedules performed slightly better. Check the metrics comparison in the folder: plots.
